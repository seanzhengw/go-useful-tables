My collection of database tables creation statement, using with golang.

All sql statements in this project were tested in MariaDB 10.

## About ORM

For normal usage with ORM, it pretty convenient.

For creating tables by ORM libraries, my concern is that it needs to learn some non-standard syntaxes for particular libraries, and if I wish to change a library, I am forced to learn it again (for just creating tables once).
